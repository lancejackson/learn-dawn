                    <p>Lance is an engineer and programmer who
                        is trying to save the world one semicolon
                        at a time. He was born and raised in the Bay, 
                        and he likes 70 degree weather and carne asada
                        fries.

                        He's doing a minor in environmental economics, 
                        hoping to do research in applied economic models. 
                        He does web development work for Pioneers in Engineering, 
                        developing the Dawn desktop application for high schoolers.
